| Gauss's Law | Electric flux through a closed surface is found by taking the total charge enclosed and dividing it by the electrical permittivity of a vacuum - a constant. | 
| Electrical permittivity of a vacuum | A physical constant that reflects the ability of electrical fields to pass through a classical vacuum. It is approximately 8.854 * 10^-12 F/m  | 
| Gaussian surface | A mathematical construct that may be of any shape, provided that it is closed. We tend to choose shapes that are highly symmetrical. |
