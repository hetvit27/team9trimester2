| Electric Field | A field of force surrounding a charged particle. | 
| Electric Potential | The difference in electrical charge between two points in a circuit expressed in volts. | 
| Field Strength | The vector sum of all the forces exerted by an electrical or magnetic field (on a unit mass or unit charge or unit magnetic pole) at a given point in the field | 
| Conductor | Permits electrons to flow freely from particle to particle. Electric field within conductors are zero. | 
| Insulator | Impede the free flow of electrons from atom to atom and molecule to molecule. |
