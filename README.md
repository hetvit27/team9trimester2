## KEBHI Physics Website

Welcome to our physics help website!

Why: AP Physics is a hard class. We all struggled through the class during junior and senior year. We wanted to make a website to help make the class easier to navigate.

What: Our website includes notes from the different units in one centeralized location. In addition, we have lab simulations to better help students understand the concepts. Our features include a tutor database to help students recieve more individualized help, an equation database to store equations from different units, a practice problem database to get more practice for each unit, and a discussion board to ask fellow students and tutors questions and recieve quick held.
