### Key Vocabulary 

| Vocabulary | Definition | 
| --- | --- | 
| Velocity | The rate at which an object changes it's position | 
| Acceleration | The rate at which an object's speed is changing | 
| Displacement | Vector quantity that is an object's overall change in position | 
| Distance | How far an object has moved; positive or negative | 
| Vectors | Have both magnitude and direction| 
| Scalars | Only magnitude (no direction) | 
| Gravitational Constant | 9.8 m/s^2 |

| First Law | An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force. | 
| Second Law | The acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. | 
| Third Law | For every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction. | 
| Center of Mass| A position defined relative to an object or system of objects. It is the average position of all the parts of the system | 
| Net Force | The vector sum of forces acting on a particle or object.|

Explanation: The car in the animation is moving at a constant speed and there are no external forces acting on the car. Therefore, the car continues at a constant velocity forever.
