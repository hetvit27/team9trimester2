## Team 9 Reunion Project
JEHB parody...KEBHI!

Our potential team project is to continue improving our Physics website by adding more coding-oriented aspects like a simulation. 

Agile Manifesto:

| What we prioritize| over what we don't |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Quality| over Quantity |
| Teamwork and Collaboration | over Finishing work fast |
| Listening to ideas  | over just listening to one person |
| Communicating problems  | over ignoring others |
