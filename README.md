# Team 9: KEBHI Physics Website

KEBHI Physics is a well-rounded platform meant to serve Del Norte Physics students to connect with tutors and one another

Why: AP Physics is a hard class. We all struggled through the class during junior and senior year. We wanted to make a website to help make the class easier to navigate.

What: Our website includes notes from the different units in one centralized location. In addition, we have lab simulations to better help students understand the concepts. Our features include a tutor database to help students receive more individualized help, an equation database to store equations from different units, a practice problem database to get more practice for each unit, and a discussion board to ask fellow students and tutors questions and receive quick held.

Features: 
- Discussion board 
- Equations page to store the equations you've learned
- Practice problems with units and tags to help study
- Tutors page to find and add any tutors you know
- Equation leaderboard to like and dislike any equations you find during your study
- Secure signup and login system that allows for secure information
