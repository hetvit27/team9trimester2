| Gauss's Law| elates the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface to the field created by that charge. This method is commonly used in problems that have spherical, cylindrical, or cubic symmetries. While symmetry is not a prerequisite for applying Gauss' law, any symmetry present can be used to simplify the mathematics of the problem. | 
| Charge Density | measure of charge per unit length, area, or volume | 
| Math | Power intensity per unit area from point source. If sun rays strike the surface of a planet at a right angle, varies inversely according to the square of the distance from the source. | 
| Free Fall | Gravity is the only force acting on an object.|
